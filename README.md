# Expense Tracker - Competition Starter

A Flutter application starter template for building an expense tracking app with data visualization capabilities.

## Project Overview

This is a barebones Flutter project set up for a coding competition. Your task is to build a fully functional expense tracker application that allows users to:

- Add and manage personal expenses
- Visualize spending patterns through charts
- Track expenses over time
- Categorize different types of expenses

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (3.8.0 or higher)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
3. Run `flutter run` to start the application

## Project Structure

The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern:

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart              # Application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ models/                # Data models
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ expense_model.dart # Expense data structure
â”œâ”€â”€ viewmodels/            # Business logic layer
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ expense_viewmodel.dart # Expense management logic
â””â”€â”€ views/                 # UI components
    â””â”€â”€ expense_view.dart  # Main expense screen
```
