# Competition Track: Flutter Expense Tracker

## Track Overview

Welcome to the Flutter Expense Tracker competition track! This challenge focuses on building a complete mobile application using Flutter with emphasis on clean architecture, data visualization, and user experience design.

## Challenge Description

You are tasked with building a personal expense tracking application that helps users manage their finances through intuitive data entry and meaningful visualizations.

### Primary Objectives

1. **Data Management**: Implement a robust system for storing and managing expense data
2. **Visualization**: Create compelling charts and graphs to help users understand their spending patterns
3. **User Experience**: Design an intuitive interface that makes expense tracking effortless
4. **Architecture**: Demonstrate proper MVVM pattern implementation

## Technical Requirements

### Must-Have Features

- [ ] **Expense Entry**: Users can add new expenses with amount, date, and description
- [ ] **Expense List**: Display all expenses in a scrollable list format
- [ ] **Data Visualization**: At least one chart showing spending patterns (daily, weekly, or monthly)
- [ ] **MVVM Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns using the provided structure
- [ ] **State Management**: Use Provider for reactive UI updates

### Architecture Guidelines

#### Model Layer (`lib/models/`)
- Define clean data structures
- Include proper data validation
- Consider serialization if implementing persistence

#### ViewModel Layer (`lib/viewmodels/`)
- Handle all business logic
- Manage application state
- Provide data to views in consumable format
- Use `ChangeNotifier` for reactive updates

#### View Layer (`lib/views/`)
- Focus purely on UI presentation
- Consume data from ViewModels
- Handle user interactions
- Maintain responsive design principles

### Technical Constraints

- Use the provided project structure
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow Flutter/Dart best practices
- Ensure code is well-documented
- Write clean, readable code

## Evaluation Rubric

### Functionality (40 points)
- **Core Features** (25 pts): All must-have features implemented and working
- **Data Accuracy** (10 pts): Calculations and data handling are correct
- **Error Handling** (5 pts): Graceful handling of edge cases

### Code Quality (30 points)
- **Architecture** (15 pts): Proper MVVM implementation
- **Code Style** (10 pts): Clean, readable, well-organized code
- **Documentation** (5 pts): Clear comments and documentation

### User Experience (20 points)
- **Interface Design** (10 pts): Intuitive and attractive UI
- **Usability** (10 pts): Easy to navigate and use

### Innovation (10 points)
- **Creative Features** (5 pts): Additional functionality beyond requirements
- **Technical Excellence** (5 pts): Advanced implementation techniques

## Bonus Challenges

Implement any of these for extra points:

### Data Enhancement
- **Categories**: Add expense categories with color coding
- **Recurring Expenses**: Support for recurring transactions
- **Budget Tracking**: Set and monitor spending budgets

### Visualization Improvements
- **Multiple Chart Types**: Bar charts, pie charts, line graphs
- **Interactive Charts**: Tap to see details, zoom, pan
- **Time Filtering**: View data by different time periods

### Advanced Features
- **Data Persistence**: Save data locally using SQLite or Hive
- **Export Functionality**: Export data to CSV or PDF
- **Search & Filter**: Find specific expenses quickly
- **Dark Mode**: Theme switching capability

### Technical Enhancements
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- **Responsive Design**: Adapt to different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, proper contrast
- **Testing**: Unit tests for business logic

## Getting Started Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic expense entry and display
2. **Iterate Quickly**: Get a working version first, then enhance
3. **Focus on Architecture**: Proper MVVM will make everything easier
4. **Test Early**: Verify functionality as you build
5. **Plan Your UI**: Sketch your interface before coding

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't put business logic in your widgets
- Don't forget to handle empty states
- Don't ignore error scenarios
- Don't overcomplicate the initial implementation
- Don't forget to test on different screen sizes

## Submission Checklist

Before submitting, ensure you have:

- [ ] All core features implemented and tested
- [ ] Code follows the provided project structure
- [ ] README.md updated with setup instructions
- [ ] No compilation errors or warnings
- [ ] App runs successfully on Android/iOS
- [ ] Code is properly commented
- [ ] Git history shows incremental development

## Time Management Suggestions

**Phase 1 (25% of time)**: Project setup and basic expense model
**Phase 2 (35% of time)**: Core functionality (add/display expenses)
**Phase 3 (25% of time)**: Data visualization implementation
**Phase 4 (15% of time)**: UI polish and bonus features

Remember: A working application with core features is better than an incomplete application with many advanced features.

Good luck, and happy coding! ðŸŽ¯
